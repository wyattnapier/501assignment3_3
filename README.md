# Assignment 3-3: LazyColumn with StickyHeaders
### App description
This application creates a list of animals that are categorized by broader type such as mammal or reptile.
The list elements are loaded lazily and the headers are sticky so that even in a longer section you can still see what category an item falls under.
Then, after scrolling past the 10th item, a button appears that automatically scrolls to the top of the list.

### Running the app
Run the app in the Android emulator and scroll down the list. After scrolling past the 10th item, the user can press the button to jump to the top of the list again.
