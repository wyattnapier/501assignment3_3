# Assignment 3-3: LazyColumn with StickyHeaders
### App description
This application creates a list of contacts that are categorized by relation to the user.
The list elements are loaded lazily and the headers are sticky so that even in a longer section you can still see what category an item falls under.
Then, after scrolling past the 10th item, a button appears that automatically scrolls to the top of the list.

### Running the app
Run the app in the Android emulator and scroll down the list. After scrolling past the 10th item, the user can press the button to jump to the top of the list again.
